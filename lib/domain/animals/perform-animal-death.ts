/**
 * Issue #538 — apply the `Deceased` status (+ `deceasedAt`) via the replayed
 * `death` observation, NOT a fire-and-forget PATCH. The higher-stakes twin of
 * #100 (offline camp-move).
 *
 * `performAnimalDeath` is the death-recording mirror of `performAnimalMove`
 * (#100), which is itself the animal-level mirror of
 * `lib/domain/mobs/move-mob.ts` `performMobMove`: the CALLER owns the animal
 * mutation; the observation door (`createObservation`) stays a PURE writer. We
 * deliberately do NOT teach the door to read `details` and self-mutate — the
 * door's only job is the atomic observation create (ADR-0006), and `move-mob`
 * already established the convention that a sibling animal/mob mutation lives
 * in the caller, inside the same `$transaction`, so the two writes commit or
 * roll back together.
 *
 * Why this op exists (the #538 root cause):
 *   The logger's offline-safe path queues ONLY the `death` observation; the
 *   animal's `status = "Deceased"` (+ `deceasedAt`) change used to ride on a
 *   separate `navigator.onLine` fire-and-forget `PATCH /api/animals/[id]` that
 *   was dropped entirely when offline (no replay queue). Wiring the status
 *   mutation onto the REPLAYED observation (this op, invoked from the
 *   `POST /api/observations` route for `type === "death"`) makes the death
 *   survive a reconnect drain: the observation queue already replays
 *   idempotently via `clientLocalId` (#206), and setting `status = "Deceased"`
 *   with the SAME `deceasedAt` is naturally idempotent on replay.
 *
 * `deceasedAt` source — the death observation's `created_at` (the queued row's
 * timestamp = the moment of recording). This is deliberately NOT `new Date()`
 * (which the dropped PATCH used): on a #206 replay `new Date()` would drift to
 * a different value each drain, whereas the observation timestamp is fixed, so
 * the animal.update is idempotent. It is also the time-anchor `deceasedAt` is
 * read for downstream (IT3/inventory exits in `lib/server/inventory-replay.ts`
 * time-anchor an animal's exit off `deceasedAt`), so the recording time — not
 * the server's replay time — is the correct value.
 *
 * No same-camp-style guard: unlike #100's camp-move, a death is a single
 * terminal transition, so the animal.update ALWAYS fires. Re-applying
 * `status = "Deceased"` + the identical `deceasedAt` is harmless on replay.
 *
 * Keying note — the animal is updated by `animalId` (the TAG column), not the
 * cuid `id`: the offline observation's `animal_id` carries the tag, and
 * `createObservation` resolves the same animal via `where: { animalId }`.
 * Keeping both on the tag means one consistent identity across the update +
 * the door's species-stamping waterfall.
